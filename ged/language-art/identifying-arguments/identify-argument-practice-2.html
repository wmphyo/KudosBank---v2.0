                    <h3>Question 1</h3>
                    <p>Electric vehicles (EVs) are becoming increasingly popular as a more environmentally friendly alternative to traditional gasoline-powered cars. Proponents argue that EVs help reduce greenhouse gas emissions, decrease dependence on fossil fuels, and promote cleaner air quality. Additionally, advancements in battery technology have improved the range and efficiency of EVs, making them a more practical option for everyday use. However, opponents point out that the production of EV batteries involves significant environmental impact, including the mining of rare minerals and energy-intensive manufacturing processes. They also raise concerns about the limited charging infrastructure and higher upfront costs compared to conventional vehicles.</p>

                <div id="quest2" class="hide">
                    <h3>Question 2</h3>
                    <p>The use of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) in agriculture has sparked considerable debate. Supporters argue that GMOs can enhance crop yields, improve resistance to pests and diseases, and contribute to food security by allowing crops to grow in less-than-ideal conditions. Additionally, GMO crops can be engineered to have better nutritional profiles. Critics, however, express concerns about the potential long-term effects of consuming GMOs on human health and the environment. There are worries about reduced biodiversity, the development of resistant pests, and the ethical implications of altering the genetic makeup of organisms.</p>

                <div id="quest3" class="hide">
                    <h3>Question 3</h3>
                    <p>The implementation of universal basic income (UBI) has been proposed as a solution to address economic inequality. Advocates of UBI argue that providing a guaranteed income to all citizens can help reduce poverty, stimulate economic growth, and provide a safety net in an increasingly automated job market. They believe UBI could promote greater financial security and personal freedom. Opponents argue that UBI could lead to inflation, disincentivize work, and place a substantial financial burden on governments. They also question whether the amount provided would be sufficient to cover basic needs and the potential impact on the overall economy.</p>
                </div>
                <div id="quest4" class="hide">
                    <h3>Question 4</h3>
                    <p>The impact of technology on education has been a topic of significant discussion. Proponents argue that technology enhances learning experiences by providing interactive tools, access to vast resources, and personalized learning opportunities. They believe that technology can engage students and support various learning styles. Critics, however, argue that excessive reliance on technology can lead to distractions, reduce face-to-face interactions, and exacerbate educational inequalities due to differing access to technology. They also express concerns about the potential for technology to replace traditional teaching methods and diminish the role of educators.</p>

                <div id="quest5" class="hide">
                    <h3>Question 5</h3>
                    <p>The debate over public transportation systems often centers on their cost-effectiveness and societal benefits. Supporters argue that public transportation reduces traffic congestion, lowers greenhouse gas emissions, and provides accessible travel options for people who do not own vehicles. They believe that investing in public transit can lead to more sustainable urban development. Opponents, however, argue that public transportation systems can be expensive to build and maintain, and may not always meet the needs of all communities. They also point out issues such as reliability, comfort, and the potential for reduced use if service is inadequate.</p>
