                    <h3>Question 1</h3>
                    <p>Remote work has become increasingly common as technology enables people to work from anywhere. Proponents of remote work argue that it offers flexibility, reduces commuting time, and can lead to increased productivity and job satisfaction. They also highlight that it can help companies save on overhead costs related to office space. However, critics argue that remote work can lead to feelings of isolation, challenges with communication and collaboration, and difficulties in maintaining a work-life balance. They also worry that it may lead to decreased productivity in some cases and challenges in managing remote teams effectively.</p>

                    <h3>Question 2</h3>
                    <p>Animal testing for medical research remains a controversial topic. Advocates for animal testing argue that it is essential for advancing medical science, developing new treatments, and ensuring the safety of medications and vaccines. They believe that animal testing has contributed significantly to medical breakthroughs. Opponents, however, argue that animal testing is unethical, causes unnecessary suffering to animals, and that alternatives, such as computer modeling and cell culture methods, could replace animal testing while still advancing research.</p>

                <div id="quest3" class="hide">
                    <h3>Question 3</h3>
                    <p>Social media platforms have transformed the way people interact and share information. Supporters of social media argue that it fosters global connections, facilitates communication, and provides a platform for social and political activism. They also note that it can help businesses reach broader audiences and engage with customers. Critics, on the other hand, argue that social media can contribute to misinformation, privacy concerns, and mental health issues. They also express concerns about the addictive nature of social media and its impact on face-to-face interactions.</p>

                <div id="quest4" class="hide">
                    <h3>Question 4</h3>
                    <p>The rise of fast fashion has been linked to various environmental and ethical issues. Advocates for fast fashion argue that it makes the latest trends more accessible and affordable for consumers. They believe it supports economic growth and provides employment opportunities in the fashion industry. Critics argue that fast fashion leads to excessive waste, pollution, and poor working conditions in garment factories. They also express concerns about the environmental impact of the rapid production cycles and the exploitation of low-wage workers.</p>

                    <h3>Question 5</h3>
                    <p>Public education funding has been a topic of debate in many regions. Supporters of increased funding argue that it is crucial for improving educational outcomes, reducing class sizes, and providing better resources for students and teachers. They believe that more funding can help address disparities in education and ensure that all students have access to quality education. Opponents argue that simply increasing funding does not necessarily lead to better educational outcomes and that other reforms, such as curriculum changes and teacher training, are also needed. They also express concerns about the efficiency of how funding is used in some school systems.</p>
