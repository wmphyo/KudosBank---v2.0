                    <h3>Question 1</h3>
                    <p>The rise of social media platforms has fundamentally altered the way people communicate and share information. On one hand, these platforms allow for global connectivity, enabling users to stay in touch with friends and family across long distances. Furthermore, they provide a space for individuals to share opinions and ideas on a large scale. However, critics argue that social media contributes to the spread of misinformation, cyberbullying, and a decrease in face-to-face interactions. As people become increasingly reliant on digital communication, concerns about privacy and the impact of social media on mental health have also emerged.</p>

                    <h3>Question 2</h3>
                    <p>Online education has experienced rapid growth in recent years, offering flexibility and accessibility for students around the world. With the convenience of learning from home, many students find it easier to balance their studies with work or other responsibilities. Additionally, online platforms often provide a wide range of resources, from video lectures to interactive forums, which can enhance the learning experience. Despite these advantages, some critics argue that online education lacks the personal interaction of traditional classroom settings, which can be crucial for learning. Technical difficulties and lack of access to reliable internet can also create barriers, especially for students in rural or low-income areas.</p>

                <div id="quest3" class="hide">
                    <h3>Question 3</h3>
                    <p>The debate over the legalization of recreational marijuana continues to divide public opinion. Advocates claim that legalizing marijuana can generate significant tax revenue, reduce the strain on the criminal justice system, and provide safe access to the drug for recreational use. In states where marijuana has already been legalized, there has been an increase in job creation and economic activity. On the other hand, opponents argue that legalization could lead to increased rates of addiction and impaired driving, posing a risk to public safety. They also express concerns about the long-term health effects of regular marijuana use, particularly on young adults.</p>

                    <h3>Question 4</h3>
                    <p>Space exploration has long captured the imagination of humanity, with advancements in technology making space travel more feasible than ever before. Proponents argue that investing in space exploration can lead to scientific breakthroughs, inspire innovation, and ensure the survival of humanity by finding alternative habitats in the event of a global catastrophe. Critics, however, contend that space exploration is an exorbitant expense that diverts resources away from pressing issues on Earth, such as poverty, healthcare, and environmental conservation. They argue that more immediate concerns should take priority over ambitious space programs.</p>

                    <h3>Question 5</h3>
                    <p>The widespread adoption of remote work, accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic, has sparked a debate about the future of traditional office environments. Supporters of remote work emphasize the benefits of increased flexibility, reduced commuting time, and better work-life balance for employees. Companies can also save on office space and related expenses. Opponents, however, argue that remote work can lead to a lack of collaboration and weaken team dynamics. They also raise concerns about employee productivity, with distractions at home potentially leading to less efficient work.</p>
