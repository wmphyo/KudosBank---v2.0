                    <h3>Question 1</h3>
                    <p>The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) in the workplace has sparked considerable debate. Advocates argue that AI can improve efficiency, automate repetitive tasks, and lead to innovations in various fields. They believe that AI can enhance productivity and create new job opportunities in tech-related sectors. However, critics are concerned that AI could lead to job displacement, increased inequality, and ethical issues related to decision-making by machines.</p>

                    <h3>Question 2</h3>
                    <p>The implementation of stricter gun control laws has been a contentious issue. Supporters argue that such laws are necessary to reduce gun violence, prevent mass shootings, and improve public safety. They believe that stricter regulations can help keep firearms out of the hands of individuals who pose a risk to themselves or others. Opponents argue that gun control measures infringe on personal freedoms and may not effectively prevent criminals from obtaining weapons.</p>

                <div id="quest3" class="hide">
                    <h3>Question 3</h3>
                    <p>The expansion of public parks and green spaces in urban areas is often debated. Proponents argue that green spaces improve residents' quality of life, provide recreational opportunities, and contribute to environmental sustainability. They believe that access to nature can enhance mental health and community well-being. On the other hand, opponents argue that the cost of maintaining these spaces can be high and that funds might be better spent on other urban infrastructure projects.</p>

                <div id="quest4" class="hide">
                    <h3>Question 4</h3>
                    <p>The use of electric scooters in cities has gained popularity. Advocates argue that electric scooters offer a convenient, eco-friendly transportation option that can reduce traffic congestion and lower carbon emissions. They believe that scooters provide an affordable way to travel short distances and can complement other forms of public transit. Critics, however, are concerned about safety issues, such as accidents involving pedestrians and improper scooter usage, and argue that regulations are needed to address these problems.</p>

                <div id="quest5" class="hide">
                    <h3>Question 5</h3>
                    <p>The concept of a four-day workweek has been proposed as a solution to improve work-life balance. Proponents argue that a shorter workweek can increase employee satisfaction, boost productivity, and reduce burnout. They believe that having an extra day off each week can lead to a more balanced and fulfilling life. Critics argue that a four-day workweek might not be feasible for all industries and could lead to longer daily work hours or reduced income for some workers.</p>
