                    <h3>Question 1</h3>
                    <p>Renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power, have gained popularity as alternatives to fossil fuels. Advocates argue that renewable energy can reduce greenhouse gas emissions, decrease reliance on finite resources, and create new job opportunities in the green energy sector. Additionally, the advancements in technology have made renewable energy more cost-effective and efficient. However, critics highlight the intermittency of renewable sources and the high initial investment required for infrastructure. They also raise concerns about the environmental impact of manufacturing and disposing of renewable energy systems.</p>

                    <h3>Question 2</h3>
                    <p>Online education has become increasingly prevalent, offering flexibility and access to a wide range of courses. Proponents of online education argue that it allows students to learn at their own pace, provides access to resources that may not be available locally, and can be more cost-effective than traditional education. Conversely, opponents argue that online education can lack the personal interaction and hands-on experiences found in traditional classrooms. They also point out challenges related to self-discipline and the digital divide, which can affect access to online learning.</p>

                <div id="quest3" class="hide">
                    <h3>Question 3</h3>
                    <p>Urban farming is increasingly seen as a solution to food security and environmental sustainability. Advocates claim that urban farming can reduce food transportation costs, provide fresh produce in urban areas, and utilize otherwise unused spaces for agriculture. They also argue that it can promote community engagement and education about sustainable practices. On the other hand, critics argue that urban farming may not be scalable to meet the needs of larger populations and could face issues related to land use, resource management, and potential contamination from urban environments.</p>
                </div>
                <div id="quest4" class="hide">
                    <h3>Question 4</h3>
                    <p>Animal conservation efforts are vital for preserving endangered species and maintaining biodiversity. Supporters argue that conservation programs help protect natural habitats, ensure the survival of endangered species, and contribute to ecological balance. They also believe that these efforts can foster global awareness and appreciation for wildlife. Opponents, however, argue that the resources devoted to animal conservation could be better used to address human issues such as poverty and health care. They also question the effectiveness of some conservation programs and their long-term sustainability.</p>
                </div>
                <div id="quest5" class="hide">
                    <h3>Question 5</h3>
                    <p>The debate over remote healthcare services, such as telemedicine, has gained traction. Advocates argue that remote healthcare provides convenience, reduces the need for travel, and can improve access to healthcare for people in remote or underserved areas. They also believe it can help reduce the burden on traditional healthcare facilities. Critics, however, argue that remote healthcare may not provide the same quality of care as in-person visits and could exacerbate health disparities due to varying levels of access to technology. They also raise concerns about data security and privacy issues.</p>
