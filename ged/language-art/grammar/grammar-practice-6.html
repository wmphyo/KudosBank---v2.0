                    twice as
                    likely to develop heart disease as those who are more active. This is true even if you have no other

                    Moreover, to get benefits, you don't have to run a marathon. Regular activity — something as simple as a
                    brisk 30-minute walk each day —
                    can help you reduce your risk of heart disease.

                    If you currently get regular physical activity, congratulations! However, if you're not yet getting all
                    the
                    activity you need, you have lots of company. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
                    (CDC), 60
                    percent of Americans are not meeting the recommended levels of physical activity.

                    Overall, women tend to be less active than men, and older people are less likely to get regular physical
                    activity than are younger individuals.

                    What does it mean to get “regular physical activity”? To reduce the risk of heart disease, adults need
                    to do only
                    about 30 minutes of moderate activity on most, and preferably all, days of the week. This level of
                    activity can also lower your chances of

                    minutes of moderate to
                    vigorous-intensity activity on most days of the week. At the same time, watch your calories.

                    If you're not as active as you might be, take a moment to consider why. Maybe you're just in the habit
                    of traveling by car or bus,
                    even when you're not going far. In your free time, perhaps it's tempting to sit down in front of the TV
                    or computer rather than
                    do something more vigorous. It's easy to get busy or tired and decide that it's just simpler to put off
                    that brisk walk or bike ride.
