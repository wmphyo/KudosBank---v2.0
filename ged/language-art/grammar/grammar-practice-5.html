            <p class="line-space">Dear Ms. Moore:</p>
            <p class="line-space">I am writing to complain about a recent development I noticed in my local Top Shelf Foods grocery store.</p>
            <p class="line-space">
                When I shop in a grocery store, I expect to have reasonable choices. I am spending my money
                <select name="options" id="ans1">
                    <option value="select">1. Select ...</option>
                    <option value="incorrect">A. in that establishment; finally, I expect to make purchases based on my personal preferences.</option>
                    <option value="incorrect">B. in that establishment; similarly, I expect to be able to make purchases based on my personal preferences.</option>
                    <option value="incorrect">C. in that establishment; however, I expect to be able to make purchase based on my personal preferences.</option>
                    <option value="correct">D. in that establishment; therefore, I expect to be able to make purchases based on my personal preferences.</option>
                </select>
                For example, I appreciate the fact that Top Shelf Foods offers its own less expensive line of canned and
                frozen foods, cleaning supplies, and other items. These may all save me money; however, sometimes I may
                prefer to buy
                a national brand due to the flavor or quality, even if it costs more. The choice
                <select name="options" id="ans2">
                    <option value="select">2. Select ...</option>
                    <option value="correct">A. is ultimately up to me.</option>
                    <option value="incorrect">B. is ultimately up for me.</option>
                    <option value="incorrect">C. is ultimately around me.</option>
                    <option value="incorrect">D. is ultimately at me.</option>
                </select>
            </p>
            <p>
                Lately, I have noticed that Top Shelf Foods is pushing its own brand of products very aggressively.
                There are fewer sales on national brands, which makes your brand an even more economical choice than
                usual.
                This is not unreasonable. However, what really bothers me
                <select name="options" id="ans3">
                    <option value="select">3. Select ...</option>
                    <option value="incorrect">A. are that many national brands that I like are disappearing from the shelves.</option>
                    <option value="incorrect">B. is that many national brands that I like is disappearing from the shelves.</option>
                    <option value="correct">C. is that many national brands that I like are disappearing from the shelves.</option>
                    <option value="incorrect">D. are that many national brands that I like is disappearing from the shelves.</option>
                </select>
                In fact, they are gradually being replaced
                <select name="options" id="ans4">
                    <option value="select">4. Select ...</option>
                    <option value="incorrect">A. by your companies' own brand.</option>
                    <option value="incorrect">B. by your companies own brand.</option>
                    <option value="incorrect">C. by your companys' own brand.</option>
                    <option value="correct">D. by your company's own brand.</option>
                </select>
                I used to have a choice between several brands of cereal and yogurt. Now there are only two: a national
                brand and the Top Shelf Foods house brand.
            </p>
            <p>
                <select name="options" id="ans5">
                    <option value="select">5. Select ...</option>
                    <option value="correct">A. Soon there may be no choice at all.</option>
                    <option value="incorrect">B. Soon their may be know choice at all.</option>
                    <option value="incorrect">C. Soon their may be no choice at all.</option>
                    <option value="INcorrect">D. Soon there may be know choice at all.</option>
                </select>
                This seems like a sneaky way to force me to buy your products. I understand that it is a good
                business practice to promote your own products. However, it should be up to the consumer to decide
                <select name="options" id="ans6">
                    <option value="select">6. Select ...</option>
                    <option value="incorrect">A. what they are willing and able to pay for.</option>
                    <option value="correct">B. what he or she is willing and able to pay for.</option>
                    <option value="incorrect">C. what they is willing and be able to pay for.</option>
                    <option value="incorrect">D. what one is willing and able to pay for.</option>
                </select>
                By depriving me of choices, Top Shelf Foods is driving me away as a customer.
            </p>
            <p>Sincerely,</p>
            <p>Michael Smith</p>
