                    </select>
                    What is a flextime schedule? Employees at most companies work 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. each day. 
                    With flextime, employees may work from 7 a.m. to 3 p.m., 8 a.m. to 4 p.m., 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., or 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. 
                    The choice is up to the employee in conjunction with his or her supervisor. By October 31, all employees must meet with
                    their supervisors and decide which schedule they will work.

                    Flextime provides several benefits for employees. 
                    <select name="options" id="ans3">
                        <option value="select">3. Select ...</option>

                        <option value="incorrect">C. First, not everyone is at one's best between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m.</option>
                        <option value="incorrect">D. First, not everyone is at his best between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m.</option>
                    </select>.
                    Some people do their best work early in the day, while others prefer to avoid an early start because their energy peaks later in the day. Still others have busy lives outside the office.
                    For example, an employee with school-age children might prefer to finish work by 3 p.m.

                    Flextime also benefits the company. Studies show that employees who can define their working hours <select name="options" id="ans4">
