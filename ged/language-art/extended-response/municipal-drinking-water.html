                <p>1. We all want our tap water to be safe and drinkable. Unfortunately, this is not always the case.
                    Tests of municipal water supplies across America raise concerns. They have found traces of
                    pesticides, and residues of industrial and agricultural chemicals, as well as traces of
                    pharmaceuticals and other contaminants. There is real concern about the effects of long-term
                    exposure to these chemicals, even in trace amounts.</p>
                <p>2. The EPA monitors and has standards for only a few chemicals. However, there are traces of more
                    than 100,000 manmade chemicals in municipal water. Despite all the purification measures, they
                    remain. They include antibiotics, and industrial pollutants. Tests have found traces of pesticides,
                    including atrazine and glyphosate, linked to reproductive and neurological issues and cancer.
                    Dissolved chemicals are not removed during filtration as long as they are below limits set by the
                    EPA.</p>
                <p>3. Municipalities filter their water, and also add treatment chemicals, including fluoride. Many
                    people are concerned about fluoridation of water and its health effects. Water treatment plants use
                    chlorine to sterilize and remove bacteriological contaminants. As these treatment chemicals break
                    down, the by-products remain in the water and are potentially harmful.</p>
                <p>4. Even when municipal water is perfectly clean, tap water in your home still can be contaminated. In
                    older parts of town, lead pipes were once common. Lead pipes are still in use in many older areas,
                    and that lead leaches into the water in the pipes. Lead ingestion can lead to developmental delays
                    and neurological problems. Bottled water is always an option for drinking water. However, some
                    bottlers merely add extra filtration to the same municipal water that comes from your tap. Others
                    don’t even do that before bottling. Studies have discovered contaminants in many brands of bottled
                    water.</p>
                <p>5. The only real safe answer is some form of home filtration. The least expensive way to improve your
                    drinking water somewhat is to use a jug with a charcoal filter cartridge. That filter removes
                    chlorine, lead, and unpleasant tastes or odors. This is an effective and inexpensive choice. More
                    extensive systems, ranging from distillation systems to high-quality filtration, will do much more,
                    even removing dissolved chemicals from the water supply. Despite municipal efforts, city water
                    supplies still have trace contaminants. If you want the taste of truly clean water, use bottled
                    water and supplement that with a filtration system that covers your house. These systems provide you
                    with exceptionally clean water, free of the many chemical impurities that municipal water systems do
                    not remove.</p>

            <div class="er-passage p-2">
                <p>1. Municipal drinking water is clean and safe. It comes from two main sources: ground waters or
                    surface water. That water is filtered, treated, and distributed in a safe manner throughout our
                    cities. Municipalities have done this for nearly 200 years and improved the process continuously.
                </p>
                <p>2. Municipalities started chlorinating water at the turn of the last century after several severe
                    outbreaks of disease. Jersey City was the first, starting in 1908. In the subsequent two decades,
                    childhood diseases from municipal water declined by 90 percent and major infectious diseases by two
                    thirds. More recently, the water treatment process has been improved to remove dissolved chemicals,
                    improve taste, and even reduce tooth decay. The delivery system too has been improved by removing
                    old lead pipes, once a cause for concern.</p>
                <p>3. Water flows through coarse screens to remove debris, and then filtration removes fine particles.
                    Flocculants remove suspended solids, and chlorination removes disease-causing organisms. Some
                    municipalities treat water with ozone or ultraviolet light rather than chlorine for extra safety.
                    Adding activated charcoal before final filtration removes organic compounds and improves taste. The
                    final step is aeration to reduce further dissolved chemicals that affect the taste of water. The EPA
                    sets standards for more than 60 contaminants, from bacteria to filtration residues and organic and
                    inorganic chemicals. That includes microorganisms such as cryptosporidium and coliform bacteria. The
                    standards set limits on permissible levels of the breakdown chemicals of chlorine and other
                    treatment chemicals. Metals such as cadmium and chromium, asbestos, and arsenic are also monitored.
                </p>
                <p>4. Municipal water systems must meet all of these standards. The EPA monitors treatment plants to
                    ensure compliance. Municipal water can have an “off” taste. Absolutely pure water has no taste, but
                    the water we drink is not just H2O. Rains, snows, and runoff from various sources leach chemicals
                    from the soil. Most of these are harmless natural salts. They add their own taste to the water.
                    Sometimes, algae or agricultural runoff in surface water also adds an unpleasant odor and taste.
                    None of this makes the drinking water unsafe.</p>
                <p>5. Municipal water treatment guarantees clean and safe water. The water is so safe, in fact, that
                    nearly one-third of bottled water is simply municipal water repackaged by bottlers. Why bother with
                    bottled water or extra filtration when your municipal supply is perfectly safe?</p>

                <p>Your task: Analyze the arguments presented in the two passages. Then, develop an argument in which
                    you explain how one position is better supported than the other. In your response, include relevant
                    and
                    specific evidence from both passages to support your argument.</p>
                <p> Remember, the better-argued position is not necessarily the position with which you agree. This task
                    should take approximately 45 minutes to complete.</p>
