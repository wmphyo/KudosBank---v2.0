            <p class="sub-heading">OSHA Standards and Work Protection</p>
            <p>OSHA standards are rules that describe the methods that employers must use to protect their employees
                from hazards. There are OSHA standards for Construction work, Agriculture, Maritime operations, and
                General Industry, which are the standards that apply to most worksites. These standards limit the amount
                of hazardous chemicals workers can be exposed to, require the use of certain safe practices and
                equipment, and require employers to monitor hazards and keep records of workplace injuries and
                illnesses. Examples of OSHA standards include requirements to : provide fall protection, prevent
                trenching cave ins, prevent some infectious diseases, assure that workers safely enter confined spaces,
                prevent exposure to harmful substances like asbestos, put guards on machines, provide respirators or
                other safety equipment, and provide training for certain dangerous jobs.</p>
            <p class="sub-heading">You Cannot Be Punished or Discriminated Against for Using Your OSHA Rights</p>
            <p>The OSHA Act protects workers who complain to their employer, OSHA, or other government agencies about
                unsafe or unhealthful working conditions in the workplace or environmental problems. You cannot be
                transferred, denied a raise, have your hours reduced, be fired, or punished in any other way because you
                used any right given to you under the OSHA Act. Help is available from OSHA for whistleblowers.</p>
            <p>If you have been punished or discriminated against for using your rights, you must file a complaint with
                OSHA within 30 days of the alleged reprisal for most complaints.</p>

            <h3>OSHA fines Norfolk Southern $802k for firing workers</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="author">
            <p>Author: The Virginian-Pilot</p>
        </div>
        <div class="passage p-2">
            <p>1. The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration announced Monday that it was fining a Norfolk
                Southern Corp. subsidiary more than $800,000 for firing three workers who had reported injuries on the
                job.</p>
            <p>2. OSHA, a division of the U.S. Department of Labor, ordered Norfolk Southern Railway Co. to pay the
                former workers a total of $802,169 in damages. The agency also said the railroad company must clear the
                workers' disciplinary records and post workplace notices and offer training on whistleblower rights.</p>
            <p>3. "OSHA's investigations have found that the company continues to retaliate against employees for
                reporting work- related injuries and has effectively created a chilling effect in the railroad
                industry," the Labor Department said in a news release.
            </p>
            <p>4. Norfolk Southern spokesman Robin Chapman said the company would appeal the decisions on all three
                workers before an administrative law judge at the Labor Department.</p>
            <p>5. Two of the three incidents occurred in 2010, according to the agency's release. An engineer in
                Louisville, Ky., and a conductor in Harrisburg, Pa., were fired after reporting injuries from falls in
                or near company bathrooms.</p>
            <p>6. Norfolk Southern accused the employees of falsifying their injuries, the agency said. The company also
                accused the conductor of failing to promptly report the injury. "The day before the injury, the employee
                had been lauded for excellent performance, highlighted by no lost work time due to injuries in his
                35-year career," according to the Labor Department release.</p>
            <p>7. OSHA found that the company hearings for both workers were "flawed." In the case of the engineer, the
                hearing "was orchestrated to intentionally support the decision to terminate the employee," the release
                said.</p>
            <p>8. In the third incident, an employee in Greenville,S.C, was fires after he reported begin hit by a
                company track. Norfolk Southern accused him of “improper performance of duties.” The agency found he was
                treated “disparately in comparison to four other employees involved in the incident,” none of whom had
                reported injuries.</p>
            <p>9. "Tiring workers for reporting an injury is not only illegal, it also endangers all workers," David
                Michaels, an assis tant US. secretary of labor, said in a statement. "To prevent more injuries, railroad
                workers must be able to report an injury without fear of retaliation."</p>

        <div class="instruction">
            <p>The first passage presents regulations of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA).
                The second passage a newspaper article about workers who successfully sued their employer, claiming that
                they were fired because they had reported injuries on the job.</p>
            <p>Read both the OSHA regulations and the news report carefully. Take a position on whether or not you think
                that the court decision was correct based on the OSHA guidelines.</p>
