    <h1>The use of surveillance camera</h1>

            <h3>Essay 1: Beware the All-Seeing Eye</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="author">
            <p>Author: Unknown</p>
        </div>
        <div class="passage p-1">
            <p>1. In a poll conducted after the 2013 Boston Marathon terror attack, 78 percent of respondents approved
                of surveillance cameras. Our desire for safety is understandable. We forget that surveillance puts our
                personal liberties at risk.</p>
            <p>2. Cities now have cameras everywhere. They are in and around stores, ATMs, traffic signals, bridges and
                tunnels, and parks. It is estimated that Chicago alone has between 10,000 and 20,000 publicly and
                privately owned security cameras. That city claims that the cameras have led to 4,500 arrests between
                2006 and 2010.</p>
            <p>3. However, such widespread use of cameras invades human privacy and infringes on our rights. History is
                littered with cases of government surveillance leading to police states where citizens’ rights are
                disregarded. </p>
            <p>4. Advocates of increased surveillance say the cameras prevent crime. That claim is debatable. Neil
                Richards, a professor of law at Washington University, notes in a recent study that although
                surveillance cameras report crime, they do not prevent crime.</p>
            <p>5. In fact, Richard notes that any camera connected to the Internet can be hacked. In other words,
                criminals can use security footage to commit crimes, too. The footage becomes one more tool criminals
                can use to discover—remotely—what time a potential victim is leaving his home or workplace. Surveillance
                cameras may actually promote crime.</p>
            <p>6. In addition, cameras do not just record criminals’ activity, they record everyone’s activity. It is
                unclear who controls the surveillance information after it is gathered, or what happens to it. Anyone
                could own the surveillance footage of you. There are currently no federal laws on the books regulating
                what happens to that footage.</p>
            <p>7. Finally, the hours of video gathered by these cameras are shot without the permission of those being
                photographed. Great effort goes into protecting the privacy of our medical records and preventing online
                identity theft. Why, then, is the area of surveillance cameras not equally regulated?</p>
            <p>8. Surveillance in the name of safety means trading safety for loss of freedom in the long run.
                Safeguards are needed—now. </p>

            <h3>Essay 2: Surveillance Cameras Improve Quality of Life</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="author">

        <div class="passage p-2">
            <p>1. The Boston Marathon bombing in 2013 shook the nation as no disaster had since 9/11. However, the
                terrorists were located and brought to justice due to the fact that their actions had been caught on
                video.</p>
            <p>2. According to the U.S. Department of Justice, about 75 percent of all crime in the country is property
                crime. Surveillance cameras on homes or businesses help owners avoid property loss; when people know
                someone’s watching them, they’re less likely to do wrong. Indeed, surveillance cameras in stores and
                businesses are known to decrease theft by customers and employees alike. Business owners can save
                thousands of dollars in crime-related losses each year by investing in camera installation.</p>
            <p>3. Security cameras protect society’s most vulnerable members: the very young, the very old, and those
                who cannot otherwise defend themselves. The kidnapping and subsequent murder of an eight-year-old boy in
                Brooklyn, New York, in 2011 led to the installation of security cameras in the neighborhood where the
                crime occurred. In 2014, police used these very cameras to prevent a similar tragedy.</p>
            <p>4. A study conducted by the Department of Justice found that increased surveillance in certain areas of
                Washington, DC, resulted in a decrease of violent crime in those areas. Similar results were observed in
                Chicago, Illinois, and Baltimore, Maryland. In Chicago, in fact, violent crime in general dropped by
                about one-fifth.</p>
            <p>5. Statistics like these point to real results. Society must use every resource it can to increase public
                safety, to lower crime rates, and to catch criminals.</p>

            <p>Your task: Analyze the arguments presented in the two passages. Then, develop an argument in which
                you explain how one position is better supported than the other. In your response, include relevant and
                specific evidence from both passages to support your argument.</p>
            <p> Remember, the better-argued position is not necessarily the position with which you agree. This task
                should take approximately 45 minutes to complete.</p>
