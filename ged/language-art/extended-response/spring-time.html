        <div class="passage p-1">
            <p>1. In the Good Old SummerTime! For most of us, setting our clocks forward one hour in March is a sure
                sign that spring is coming, followed by summer! After a long, hard winter, particularly in the cold
                northern states, summer is a welcome time. Kids are out of school, it may be time for a vacation,
                and we can barbecue, hike, and enjoy the great outdoors. It’s time for patios, porches, parks, and
                back yards!</p>
            <p>2. One of the big advantages of daylight savings time is that it gives us more time to enjoy the
                great outdoors in summer. Studies show that people are more active on summer evenings if they have
                an extra hour of daytime to enjoy. And because of the crisis of obesity in America, more exercise is
                better for everyone, and the country!</p>
            <p>3. Daylight savings time has some other advantages, too. Traffic studies show that accidents go down
                during daylight savings time because of the longer daylight hours. And daylight savings time helps
                the economy, too, because longer hours of daylight in the afternoon encourage people to go out and
                spend. Malls, shopping centers, and downtowns are more likely to be filled when it’s light outside.
            </p>
            <p>4. So daylight savings time is really beneficial! We should definitely keep this long standing
                practice so that everyone can reap the benefits.</p>

            <h3>Passage 2: Spring Forward, Fall Back — Far Back!</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="author">
            <p>Author: Unknown</p>
        </div>
        <div class="passage p-2">
            <p>1. Daylight savings time is a relatively new idea that is now past its prime. Daylight savings time
                was started only during World War I. Its purpose was to reduce the consumption of important
                supplies, such as fuel and candles, by allowing for an extra hour of daylight each day. Later, it
                was reimposed to encourage shopping and outdoor activities in summer. However, this practice is now
                outmoded. Studies show that the transition to daylight savings time costs our country billions as
                companies, computer systems, and schedules have to be adjusted twice a year on such a massive scale.
            </p>
            <p>2. Medical studies show that disrupted sleep patterns have all sorts of negative consequences. Heart
                attacks and strokes go up right after the switchover because of the related stress. And everyone’s
                circadian rhythms are disrupted twice a year, which causes symptoms similar to jet lag. This also
                causes auto accidents to soar in the days after the transitions as groggy drivers get into needless
                traffic accidents. Workplace accidents increase too, as sleep-deprived workers make careless
                mistakes. In addition, studies of workplaces show that productivity goes down in the days after the
                twice-annual change-overs. Orders are messed up, and work has to be redone as workers recover from
                disrupted rest patterns.</p>
            <p>3. Daylight savings time has also lost the energy savings that once made it attractive. Because
                people nowadays run their air conditioners day and night, energy consumption will not be much
                affected.</p>
            <p>4. Keeping daylight savings time is also bad for international business. Globally, fewer countries
                than ever before continue to observe daylight savings time. The European Union recently decided to
                do away with daylight savings time for just the reasons already mentioned. Each year, the U.S.
                airline industry loses an average of $150 million realigning schedules to those of countries that
                don’t observe daylight savings time. All of the disruption puts the United States at a disadvantage
                with the rest of the world.</p>

            <p>Your task: Analyze the arguments presented in the two passages. Then, develop an argument in which
                you explain how one position is better supported than the other. In your response, include relevant and
                specific evidence from both passages to support your argument.</p>
            <p> Remember, the better-argued position is not necessarily the position with which you agree. This task
                should take approximately 45 minutes to complete.</p>
