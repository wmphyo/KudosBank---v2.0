                <h3>Subject Line: Why Isn’t the Weight Coming Off? Have You Tried Morning Fasts?</h3>
            </div>
            <div class="author">
                <p>Author: Tough Talk Gym Admin</p>
            </div>
            <p class="forewords">Hey Tough Talk Gym members, we hear you—you’re frustrated that you work out regularly
                with us and yet do not see the weight coming off the way you would like. We’re writing today to suggest
                you join us in trying a simple and effective way to lose extra weight without fuss: morning fasts!
            </p>
            <div class="er-passage p-1">
                <p class="sub-heading">What is a Morning Fast?</p>
                <p>Pretty much just what it sounds like: you refrain from eating until noon. It’s okay to drink water
                    and other beverages (although we always advise against drinking alcohol and sugary soda drinks!),
                    but no food should pass your lips until the clock strikes 12 times!</p>
                <p>The concept is simple: by depriving your body of fresh nutrients during the morning, you force it to
                    burn reserves (also known as fat!), and that causes weight loss. When you fast in the morning,
                    you’re adding more hours without food to those you’ve already slept through, making the fasting more
                    likely to succeed.</p>
                <p class="sub-heading">Why is Fasting Safe?</p>
                <p>Fasting is an ancient idea. Most major religions practice some form of fasting, continuing traditions
                    that started thousands of years ago. You read the papers and keep on top of the news, so you know
                    that millions of people have fasted throughout history without any sort of major health issues.</p>
                <p>Science backs us up on this. In a 1995 study of 14 participants, those who fasted through noon
                    everyday lost an average of 5 pounds after 2 weeks on the program. That’s the kind of weight loss
                    that a little discomfort is worth, right?</p>
                <p>As great as the weight loss is, though, the real benefit of fasting is the mental clarity you gain
                    from doing it. When your body is relying on extra reserves of fat, it’s burning through the weight
                    that’s been holding you back. You will feel lighter, physically and mentally, and you’ll see a
                    sharpened awareness for the beauty of the world around you.</p>

                <h3>Think carefully before you start fasting!</h3>
            </div>
            <div class="author">
                <p>Author: The Doctors of the Belleville Consortium</p>
            </div>
            <div class="er-passage p-2">
                <p>Dear Friends: There’s no other way to say it except clearly: fasting is not a healthy choice. We, the
                    doctors of the Bonneville Medical Consortium, are moved to write to you after receiving numerous
                    requests to sign “Physician’s Permission Forms” for you, asking us to sign off on trying Tough Talk
                    Gym’s new morning fasting program. We love Tough Talk Gym—it’s great to have a full-scale gymnasium
                    with a caring, committed staff of trainers in a town of our size—but we cannot condone this new
                    program. It is unsafe, but, more importantly, it will not get you the results you want. We know that
                    Tough Talk has made several claims about fasting, so we want to clearly explain why they are not
                    true.</p>
                <p>First, Tough Talk points to the tradition of religious fasting and claims that it has never resulted
                    in harm to any who practice it. That’s not true. A 2012 study of over 1,000 people who fast as part
                    of their religious practice shows that they are more likely to faint, cause vehicular accidents
                    because of muddled thinking, and make poor safety choices by a ratio of nearly 3 to 1, when compared
                    to those who are not fasting. You should also keep in mind that fasting for religious observances
                    generally means avoiding food for a day, week, or month, not a continuous program of skipping all
                    food before noon for years.</p>
                <p>Secondly, fasting can lead to nutritional imbalances. What often happens is that the person fasting
                    is so ravenous that by the time they can eat again, they eat too much food— far in excess of what
                    they would normally eat over the course of breakfast and lunch. People who are hungry will naturally
                    reach for high-fat, high-sugar foods, as well, and often allow themselves to overindulge in them,
                    because they think, “Well, I didn’t eat any breakfast.”</p>
                <p>Finally, and perhaps most dishearteningly, fasting often backfires as a weight loss technique.
                    Besides the problem with overeating, as mentioned above, fasting does not always force the body to
                    burn extra reserves of fat, as Tough Talk claims. Instead, the body’s metabolism is likely to slow,
                    burning less fat in order to protect it. This is because our bodies may react to fasting as a
                    stressor and could shift into survival mode to help us endure when not much food is coming in. Thus,
                    weight loss may not increase at all.</p>
                <p>While we understand the desire to regain a healthy weight, as well as the constant hope that some
                    sort of fad diet will make doing so easier, the only real way to lose weight is through a healthy
                    diet and an exercise plan. We stand by ready to help you put that together—and to cheer you on as
                    you lose those extra pounds! Just give us a call!</p>
                <p>Yours in good health,</p>

                <p>Your task: Analyze the arguments presented in the two passages. Then, develop an argument in which
                    you explain how one position is better supported than the other. In your response, include relevant
                    and
                    specific evidence from both passages to support your argument.</p>
                <p> Remember, the better-argued position is not necessarily the position with which you agree. This task
                    should take approximately 45 minutes to complete.</p>
