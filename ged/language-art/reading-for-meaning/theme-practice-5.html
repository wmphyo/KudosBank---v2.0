                    <h3>Question 1</h3>
                    <p>In 'Things Fall Apart' by Chinua Achebe, the theme of cultural clash is central to the narrative. The novel portrays the life of Okonkwo, a respected leader in the Igbo community, whose life is turned upside down with the arrival of European colonizers and their Christian missionaries. The story explores the impact of colonialism on the Igbo society, as traditional customs and beliefs are challenged and often destroyed. Achebe illustrates the complexities of cultural identity and the devastating effects of cultural imperialism on indigenous communities. Through Okonkwo's personal tragedy and the broader societal changes, the novel highlights the conflict between traditional African values and the forces of change brought by European colonization.</p>

                    <h3>Question 2</h3>
                    <p>In 'The Handmaid's Tale' by Margaret Atwood, the theme of female oppression is explored in a dystopian society where women have been stripped of their rights and reduced to their reproductive functions. The protagonist, Offred, is a Handmaid whose sole purpose is to bear children for the ruling class. The novel delves into the ways in which authoritarian regimes use power and control to subjugate women, employing fear, propaganda, and violence. Atwood's portrayal of Gilead serves as a chilling reminder of the fragility of women's rights and the ease with which freedoms can be eroded in the face of political and religious extremism.</p>

                    <h3>Question 3</h3>
                    <p>In 'Crime and Punishment' by Fyodor Dostoevsky, the theme of guilt and redemption is central to the protagonist's journey. Raskolnikov, a former student living in poverty, commits a brutal murder under the belief that he is justified in his actions by a higher moral reasoning. However, he soon finds himself consumed by guilt and paranoia. Throughout the novel, Dostoevsky examines the psychological torment that Raskolnikov undergoes and his eventual quest for redemption. The novel delves deeply into the moral and ethical dilemmas of crime, punishment, and the possibility of atonement.</p>

                    <h3>Question 4</h3>
                    <p>In 'The Catcher in the Rye' by J.D. Salinger, the theme of alienation is a prominent aspect of the protagonist's life. Holden Caulfield, a teenage boy who has been expelled from several schools, spends a few days in New York City before returning home. Throughout the novel, Holden grapples with feelings of isolation and disconnection from the world around him. He criticizes the phoniness of adult society and yearns to protect the innocence of children. Salinger captures the struggles of adolescence, the search for identity, and the pain of growing up in a world that often seems hypocritical and superficial.</p>

                    <h3>Question 5</h3>
                    <p>In 'Their Eyes Were Watching God' by Zora Neale Hurston, the theme of self-discovery and empowerment is central to Janie Crawford's journey. The novel follows Janie's life from her childhood through three marriages and her quest for independence and self-fulfillment. Janie's experiences with love, loss, and resilience shape her understanding of herself and her place in the world. Hurston's narrative celebrates the strength and determination of an African American woman who defies societal expectations to find her own voice and identity.</p>
