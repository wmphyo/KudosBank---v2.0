                    <h3>Question 1</h3>
                    <p>In Khaled Hosseini's 'The Kite Runner', the theme of redemption is central to the narrative. The novel follows the story of Amir, a boy from a wealthy family in Kabul, who forms a complex friendship with Hassan, the son of his father's servant. After witnessing a traumatic event and failing to act, Amir spends much of his life grappling with guilt and seeking redemption. The story spans from Amir's childhood in Afghanistan to his adult years in America, highlighting his internal struggle and eventual journey back to his homeland to make amends for his past mistakes. Through Amir's experiences, Hosseini explores the idea that redemption is achievable through courage, self-sacrifice, and a willingness to confront one's past.</p>

                    <h3>Question 2</h3>
                    <p>In 'A Tale of Two Cities' by Charles Dickens, the theme of resurrection is prevalent throughout the novel. Set against the backdrop of the French Revolution, the story follows several characters whose lives are interconnected by the upheaval of the times. One of the most significant arcs is that of Dr. Manette, who is "recalled to life" after being wrongfully imprisoned for eighteen years. His release and subsequent reunion with his daughter, Lucie, symbolize the idea of personal and societal rebirth. Additionally, the self-sacrifice of Sydney Carton, who gives his life to save another, serves as a powerful example of redemption and the possibility of a second chance.</p>

                    <h3>Question 3</h3>
                    <p>In 'Beloved' by Toni Morrison, the theme of trauma and memory is intricately woven into the narrative. The story revolves around Sethe, a former slave who is haunted by the ghost of her dead daughter, Beloved. Sethe's experiences of slavery and the horrific act she commits to save her children from a similar fate are central to her character and the novel's exploration of the lasting impact of trauma. Morrison uses vivid imagery and symbolism to convey how the past continuously affects the present, illustrating the struggle to overcome painful memories and find a path toward healing and reconciliation.</p>

                    <h3>Question 4</h3>
                    <p>In 'Brave New World' by Aldous Huxley, the theme of the dangers of a controlled society is explored. The novel is set in a dystopian future where the World State maintains control over its citizens through advanced technology, conditioning, and a rigid caste system. Individuality and personal freedoms are sacrificed for the sake of societal stability and superficial happiness. The protagonist, Bernard Marx, becomes increasingly disillusioned with this controlled existence and seeks something more meaningful. Huxley's portrayal of a society devoid of true emotions, creativity, and personal connections serves as a cautionary tale about the loss of humanity in the pursuit of technological and social order.</p>

                    <h3>Question 5</h3>
                    <p>In 'Middlemarch' by George Eliot, the theme of idealism versus reality is examined through the lives of several characters in a provincial town. Dorothea Brooke, an idealistic young woman, dreams of making significant social contributions through a marriage to the scholarly but ineffective Mr. Casaubon. Her disappointment in the marriage and eventual realization of her own potential reflect the clash between her idealistic aspirations and the realities of life. Similarly, the ambitions and struggles of other characters in the novel illustrate the broader societal and personal conflicts between lofty ideals and practical limitations. Eliot's detailed portrayal of Middlemarch society provides a nuanced exploration of the complexities of human nature and the pursuit of personal fulfillment.</p>
