                    <h3>Question 1</h3>
                    <p>Urban gardening has become a popular trend in many cities around the world. Residents are transforming rooftops, balconies, and vacant lots into green spaces that produce fresh fruits and vegetables. This movement not only provides urban dwellers with access to healthy food but also promotes environmental sustainability by increasing green spaces and reducing the carbon footprint associated with transporting food from rural areas.</p>

                <div id="quest2" class="hide">
                    <h3>Question 2</h3>
                    <p>Mindfulness meditation has been shown to have numerous benefits for mental and physical health. By focusing on the present moment and practicing non-judgmental awareness, individuals can reduce stress, improve concentration, and enhance emotional well-being. Regular meditation practice can also lead to lower blood pressure, improved sleep, and a stronger immune system.</p>

                    <h3>Question 3</h3>
                    <p>Electric vehicles (EVs) are gaining popularity as a sustainable alternative to traditional gasoline-powered cars. EVs produce zero emissions, which helps reduce air pollution and combat climate change. Advances in battery technology are making EVs more affordable and increasing their range, encouraging more consumers to make the switch to electric transportation.</p>

                    <h3>Question 4</h3>
                    <p>The decline of bee populations worldwide has raised concerns among scientists and environmentalists. Bees play a crucial role in pollinating plants, which is essential for food production and maintaining biodiversity. Factors such as pesticide use, habitat loss, and climate change are contributing to the decline. Efforts to protect and restore bee habitats are vital for ensuring the sustainability of our ecosystems.</p>

                    <h3>Question 5</h3>
                    <p>Telecommuting has become increasingly common in the modern workplace. Advances in technology allow employees to work from home or other remote locations, providing greater flexibility and work-life balance. Telecommuting can lead to increased productivity, reduced commuting costs, and a smaller environmental impact due to fewer cars on the road.</p>
