                    <h3>Question 1</h3>
                    <p>In the vibrant town of Crestwood, two parks are particularly popular: Oak Park and Maple Park. Oak Park is known for its lush gardens, walking trails, and tranquil pond, providing a peaceful retreat for nature lovers. Maple Park, in contrast, features extensive playgrounds, sports fields, and picnic areas, attracting families and sports enthusiasts. While both parks are well-loved, residents often debate which park offers a more enjoyable experience.</p>

                    <h3>Question 2</h3>
                    <p>Electric vehicles (EVs) are becoming more prevalent as a sustainable alternative to gasoline-powered cars. EVs produce no tailpipe emissions and can be powered by renewable energy sources, making them an environmentally friendly choice. However, challenges such as limited charging infrastructure and the higher initial cost of EVs remain significant barriers to widespread adoption.</p>

                    <h3>Question 3</h3>
                    <p>In the coastal village of Seabreeze, the annual Beach Cleanup Day brings the community together to remove litter from the shoreline. Volunteers of all ages participate, collecting plastic waste, discarded fishing gear, and other debris. The event not only helps to keep the beaches clean but also raises awareness about the importance of protecting marine environments from pollution.</p>

                    <h3>Question 4</h3>
                    <p>Advances in medical technology have significantly improved healthcare outcomes. Innovations such as telemedicine, robotic surgery, and personalized medicine have made treatments more accessible and effective. These technologies enable doctors to diagnose and treat patients more precisely, although they also present challenges like ensuring data privacy and managing costs.</p>

                    <h3>Question 5</h3>
                    <p>Globalization has led to increased interconnectedness between countries, fostering economic growth and cultural exchange. However, it has also brought challenges such as economic inequality and cultural homogenization. Balancing the benefits and drawbacks of globalization is a complex issue faced by policymakers worldwide.</p>
