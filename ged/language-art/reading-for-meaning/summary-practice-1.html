                    <h3>Question 3</h3>
                    <p>In a quiet village, a young boy named Oliver dreams of exploring the world beyond his hometown. One day, he discovers a hidden path in the forest that leads to a bustling city. Excited and nervous, Oliver ventures into the city, meeting new friends and encountering challenges that test his courage and kindness. By the end of his journey, Oliver realizes that while adventure is thrilling, the true joy lies in the friends he makes and the lessons he learns along the way.</p>

                    <h3>Question 4</h3>
                    <p>Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants and some other organisms use sunlight to synthesize foods with the help of chlorophyll. During photosynthesis, plants absorb carbon dioxide from the air and water from the soil, and convert these into glucose and oxygen. This process not only provides essential nutrients for the plants themselves but also produces oxygen, which is vital for most living organisms on Earth.</p>

                    <h3>Question 5</h3>
                    <p>The Industrial Revolution, which began in the late 18th century, was a period of significant technological advancement and economic change. It marked the transition from agrarian societies to industrialized cities with the development of machinery and factories. This era saw the rise of new industries, increased productivity, and profound changes in living and working conditions, ultimately shaping the modern world.</p>
