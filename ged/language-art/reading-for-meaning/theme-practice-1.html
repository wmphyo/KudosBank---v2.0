                    <h3>Question 1</h3>
                    <p>In the novel 'To Kill a Mockingbird' by Harper Lee, the theme of racial injustice is prominent throughout the story. Set in the southern United States during the 1930s, the narrative follows Atticus Finch, a lawyer who defends a black man falsely accused of raping a white woman. Despite overwhelming evidence of the man's innocence, the deeply ingrained racism of the community leads to an unjust verdict. Through the characters' experiences and interactions, Lee explores the pervasive effects of prejudice and the struggle for equality in a society divided by race.</p>

                    <h3>Question 2</h3>
                    <p>In George Orwell's '1984', the theme of totalitarianism is evident as the story unfolds in a dystopian society controlled by a tyrannical government. The protagonist, Winston Smith, struggles with the oppressive regime that seeks to control not only the actions but also the thoughts of its citizens. Through constant surveillance and propaganda, the Party enforces absolute conformity and loyalty, eradicating any form of dissent.</p>

                    <h3>Question 3</h3>
                    <p>In The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald, the theme of the American Dream is scrutinized through the lives of the characters. Jay Gatsby's lavish parties and opulent lifestyle are a facade masking his deep longing for a lost love and his belief that wealth can bring happiness and social status. The novel reveals the hollowness and moral decay that often accompanies the pursuit of wealth and the elusive American Dream.</p>

                <div id="quest4" class="hide">
                    <h3>Question 4</h3>
                    <p>Mary Shelley's 'Frankenstein' delves into the theme of scientific responsibility and the ethical limits of human ambition. Victor Frankenstein's obsession with creating life leads to catastrophic consequences as his creation becomes a monster that he cannot control. The novel explores the dangers of unchecked scientific experimentation and the moral responsibilities that come with great power.</p>

                <div id="quest5" class="hide">
                    <h3>Question 5</h3>
                    <p>In 'Pride and Prejudice' by Jane Austen, the theme of social class and marriage is central to the plot. Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy must navigate the prejudices and expectations of their respective social standings to find happiness together. The novel critiques the rigid class structure of the time and the importance placed on marriage for social and economic security.</p>
