Since Midge wants to see if objects with more mass fall at a faster rate, then she must know the mass of each object she tests. She won’t know if there is a relationship between mass and rate of falling unless she knows both the mass of the object, and the rate at which the object fell to the ground. Dropping the balls from a different height should not affect the results of the experiment. That is, the rate of falling should be the same for any height from which the balls are dropped. The important thing would be to make sure all balls are dropped from the same height. Testing the balls twice does represent an improvement to the experimental design, but it is not the best way to improve the experimental design. As described above, Midge must know the mass of the balls to be able to answer the question of whether objects with more mass fall at a faster rate. Using balls of different sizes would not improve the design of the experiment. In fact, this would make the results less reliable.

The best way to improve the design of the experiment is to set up the experiment in triplicate. By testing three strawberries under each of the three conditions being tested, the researchers will have more reliable data. Placing the strawberries in different locations will not improve the design of the experiment because this represents an additional variable. Placing all strawberries into the same bag would represent a bad experimental design, because it no longer allows the researcher to compare the differences in decomposition for a strawberry exposed to no yeast, a teaspoon of yeast, or a tablespoon of yeast. That is, all three strawberries would be exposed to the same conditions if they were all in the same bag together. Recording observations after just three days, rather than five, does not improve the experiment.

A tablespoon of a different type of active yeast was added to bag #2.” This is a potential source of error, because two variables are being manipulated: both type and amount of yeast added. It would have been better to use the same type of yeast in both bags #1 and #2, since two different amounts of yeast were added. Alternatively, the researchers could have used two different types of yeast, but then they should have kept the amount of yeast constant for bags #1 and #2. Experimental results are most reliable when all variables are held constant, other than the one being tested. Although no yeast was added to the third bag, this represents good experimental design because it is a control. The control allows the researchers to observe the difference between strawberries exposed to yeast, and strawberries not exposed to yeast. Using strawberries of the same size, and all freshly picked was the best way to keep the three tests constant with respect to the strawberry used. Using three separate bags allowed the researchers to observe the differences in decomposition for a strawberry exposed to no yeast, a teaspoon of yeast, or a tablespoon of yeast.

These ions can be absorbed by the plant, producing flowers that are blue and purple.” Therefore, it is not simply the pH of the soil that affects the flower color, but more specifically, it is the availability of aluminum ions in the soil that influences the color of the flowers.   Since the pH of the soil beneath her plant was found to be 6.9, she probably needed to add more ammonium sulfate to lower the pH even more.
