One tank contained the normal atmospheric conditions of 390 microatmospheres of CO2. The other tanks contained 600, 700, and 900 microatmospheres of CO2, respectively. The same number of eggs was placed into each aquarium.

                    <h3>Question 3</h3>
                    <p>A student conducted an experiment to investigate the process of photosynthesis. She filled 2 beakers with 100 ml of distilled water. She clipped 2 large leaves from an ivy plant and placed one leaf into each beaker. She then placed one of the beakers in a sunny location, and one in a dark closet. After two hours she compared the two beakers and noticed that there were many small bubbles at the edges of the plant that had been in the sun, but the bubbles were not present on the leaf that had been in the dark.</p>

                    <p>A pharmaceutical company was testing out a new drug that was intended to lower blood pressure in diabetic patients. Two groups of volunteers were assembled. Group 1 consisted of 200 men, whereas Group 2 consisted of 200 women. All of the trial’s participants were diabetics between the ages of 20 and 50 with similar lifestyles, diet, and general health. Group 2 was given the trial drug, while Group 1 was given a sugar pill as a placebo (fake pill).  </p>

                    <h3>Question 5</h3>
                    <p>High levels of dissolved carbon dioxide can increase the acidity of water and potentially harm the marine life living there. Scientists conducted an experiment to see whether increased acidity affects hearing in fish. One hundred fertilized eggs from the same parent fish were placed in three separate tanks of water. Tank A contained water with the usual atmospheric pressure of carbon dioxide (400 microatmospheres). The carbon dioxide pressure levels in Tanks B and C were 800 microatmospheres and 1,200 micro atmospheres, respectively. Once the fish reached maturity, underwater speakers placed at one end of each tank played the sounds of the fish’s natural predators (these sounds could be heard only when the fish were near the speaker). The positions of the fish in each tank were recorded throughout the experiment. It was found that the fish raised in elevated carbon dioxide levels did not avoid the sound of the predators. However, the fish raised in regular carbon dioxide levels did avoid the end of the tank that had the speaker.  </p>
