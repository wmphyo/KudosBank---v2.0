                    <h3>Question 1</h3>
                    <p>A student is interested in designing several experiments to test the factors that effect how quickly an Alka-Seltzer® tablet dissolves in water (solution rate). She noticed that when the cup was shaken, the tablet dissolved faster. She wonders if stirring has effect on solution rate. So, she plans to investigate with two cups of water, each containing one tablet, with or without stirring it.</p>

                    <h3>Question 2</h3>
                    <p>1 The Sahara Desert and the Nile River are the two components of Egypt's natural environment. In Egypt, 99% of the population lives on only 5.5% of the total area, residing along the banks of the Nile. This small percent represents the only farmland in Egypt. Annual flooding of the Nile supplies water for crop production. Without this water source, civilization in Egypt would be very different.</p>
                    <p>2 Records indicate that a drought caused the demise of Egypt's Old Kingdom (2686-2181 BCE). Because of an insufficient water supply, food production decreased, the population suffered from famine, and the political system destabilized. Scientists have recently investigated whether other evidence supports the theory that a shift in climate led to political upheaval in Egypt about 4,200 years ago.</p>
                    <p>3 One group of researchers removed a sediment core from the Nile delta. The layers within this sediment core allowed researchers to investigate environmental conditions over thousands of years. The researchers hypothesized and observed that periods of low concentrations of pollen from wetland plants and elevated concentrations of microscopic charcoal would occur together, indicating a decrease in vegetation and an increase in natural fires during drought years.</p>
                    <p>4 A second group of researchers also examined sediment cores by analyzing shifts in the amounts of sediment deposited over time. These researchers hypothesized that a decrease in rainfall would correspond to diminished vegetative cover, which in turn would lead to an increase in erosion. This increase in erosion represented drought-like conditions and could be observed as larger deposits of sediment within the cores.</p>

                    <h3>Question 4</h3>
                    <p>How often have you seen a young child and said, “She takes after her parents”? Many traits in a child do come from her parents. Physical and other characteristics, such as hair color and nose shape, are transmitted from one generation to the next. These characteristics, passed from one generation to the next, exist because of genetic code. The first scientist to experiment with heredity was Gregor Mendel during the 19th century. Mendel experimented with pea plants and noted that characteristics appearing in “child” plants were similar to the “parent” plants. Mendel hypothesized that these characteristics were carried from generation to generation by “factors.” It took many years of research to understand why children often look like their parents, but genetic code is now the basis of the study of heredity.</p>

                    <h3>Question 5</h3>
                    <p>In 1908, a huge explosion known as the Tunguska Event flattened trees for miles across a remote area of Russia. Scientists now think an asteroid or a comet entered Earth's atmosphere, causing the explosion. Ice core samples from an Ice sheet in Greenland reveal signs of this enormous explosion: deposits of ammonia equal to 5 micrograms per square meter. But how exactly did these telltale molecules form?</p>
                    <p><b>Hypothesis 1:</b> The Tunguska explosion started forest fires, known to produce ammonia. Data indicates that such fires would have deposited an amount of ammonia over the Northern Hemisphere equaling 0.1 micrograms per square meter.</p>
                    <p><b>Hypothesis 2:</b> Up to 1% of the object's mass might have been ammonia, and this ammonia might have spread over the Northern Hemisphere. Approximately 0.00005 micrograms of ammonia per square meter are predicted by this hypothesis.</p>
                    <p><b>Hypothesis 3:</b> Since many compounds form in the presence of high heat, the ammonia could have been produced as the falling object heated the atmosphere. However, heat alone is not sufficient to cause the formation of ammonia.</p>
                    <p><b>Hypothesis 4:</b> As it passed through the atmosphere, the object pushed air in front of it at high pressure. Nitrogen and hydrogen combine to form ammonia under similar pressure.</p>
