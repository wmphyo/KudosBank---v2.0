                    <p>A pharmaceutical company was testing out a new drug that was intended to lower blood pressure in diabetic patients. Two groups of volunteers were assembled. Group 1 consisted of 200 men, whereas Group 2 consisted of 200 women. All of the trial’s participants were diabetics between the ages of 20 and 50 with similar lifestyles, diet, and general health. Group 2 was given the trial drug, while Group 1 was given a sugar pill as a placebo (fake pill).</p>

                    <p>Midge is conducting an experiment to see if objects with more mass fall at a faster rate. She has a volleyball, a bowling ball, and a soccer ball of approximately the same size. She drops each of the balls from a height of 15 feet and records the time it takes for each to hit the ground.</p>

                    <p>Strawberries and Yeast Experiment.</p>
                    <p>An experiment was conducted in which three freshly picked strawberries of the same size were each placed into three separate plastic bags. A teaspoon of active yeast was added to bag #1. A tablespoon of a different type of active yeast was added to bag #2. No yeast was added to bag #3. All three bags were placed in the same dark location. After five days, the following observations were made:</p>
                    <p>1. Bag #1 and bag #2 were both slightly inflated.</p>
                    <p>2. The strawberry in bag #2 was the most broken down.</p>
                    <p>3. The strawberry in bag #3 was still mainly intact.</p>
