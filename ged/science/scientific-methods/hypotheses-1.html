                    <h3>Question 1</h3>
                    <p>High levels of dissolved carbon dioxide can increase the acidity of water and potentially harm the marine life living there. Scientists conducted an experiment to see whether increased acidity affects hearing in fish. One hundred fertilized eggs from the same parent fish were placed in three separate tanks of water. Tank A contained water with the usual atmospheric pressure of carbon dioxide (400 microatmospheres). The carbon dioxide pressure levels in Tanks B and C were 800 microatmospheres and 1,200 micro atmospheres, respectively. Once the fish reached maturity, underwater speakers placed at one end of each tank played the sounds of the fish’s natural predators (these sounds could be heard only when the fish were near the speaker). The positions of the fish in each tank were recorded throughout the experiment. It was found that the fish raised in elevated carbon dioxide levels did not avoid the sound of the predators. However, the fish raised in regular carbon dioxide levels did avoid the end of the tank that had the speaker.</p>

                    <h3>Question 2</h3>
                    <p>A majority of teenagers develop acne, but scientists still struggle to explain its cause. It has long been thought that bacteria play a role, although until recently it was assumed that role was purely detrimental—contributing to acne. However, a team of researchers began to wonder whether different strains of bacteria might impact acne in different ways. The research team studied 49 individuals with acne and 52 individuals without acne, and the researchers collected samples of bacteria from the nasal pores of all those individuals. The researchers found that some combinations of bacterial strains were highly likely to be found in clear skinned individuals, while other combinations were highly likely to be found in individuals with acne. After carefully analyzing their data, the scientists concluded that, while some bacterial combinations likely contribute to acne, other bacterial combinations may actually help to ward it off. The researchers suggested that, if further studies confirm these findings, we may want to treat acne by encouraging the growth of helpful bacteria.</p>

                    <h3>Question 3</h3>
                    <p>Suppose that you notice your right knee hurts every time you play softball. You suspect that one of the movements involved in playing softball is causing your knee to hurt, but you are not sure which movement is the culprit. You decide to do a scientific investigation to find out more.</p>

                    <h3>Question 4</h3>
                    <p>An office manager noticed that each time she touched the metal filing cabinet next to her desk, she experienced an electrostatic shock (commonly known as “static”). Her assistant, however, only rarely experienced such shocks when touching the cabinet. The office manager liked to wear nylon clothing, and her assistant usually wore cotton clothing. Most of the days, they wore similar types of slippers.  The office manager wondered why this might be.</p>

                    <h3>Question 5</h3>
                    <p>The scientist researched the growth rate of plants at various greenhouses, some of which use cool water and some of which use warm water to water their plants. Then, for 6 weeks, the scientist used water at 75 degrees to water plants in Group A and used water at 55 degrees to water plants in Group B. He recorded their growth during this period. At the end of 6 weeks, the plants in Group A were, on average, 2 inches taller than plants in Group B. The scientist interpreted this to mean that warm water is better for plants than cool water.</p>
