                    <h3>Question 1</h3>
                    <p>A scientist designed an experiment in which he took a random sample of patients who tested positive
                        for measles and found out whether, prior to their infection with the disease, they had received no
                        measles vaccine, one dose of vaccine, or two doses of vaccine. He surveyed 100 patients who tested
                        positive for measles and found that 7 people had received one dose of measles vaccine, 3 people had
                        received two doses, and 90 people had not had the vaccine.</p>

                    <h3>Question 2</h3>
                    <p>Researchers in a particular city theorize that decreasing the greenhouse gas emissions in that city will result in better respiratory health for its citizens. In order to test this theory, they institute two programs. The first program provides commuters with financial incentives to take public transportation, and the second program initiates a respiratory care education campaign and provides free clinics for citizens suffering from respiratory health issues. During the five years after the researchers institute the two programs, greenhouse gas emissions in the city decrease by 50%, and a citywide survey reveals that cases of illness due to respiratory problems have decreased by 65%. Researchers therefore conclude that their theory was correct: Decreasing greenhouse gas emissions resulted in better respiratory health for local citizens.</p>

                    <h3>Question 3</h3>
                    <p>Some of the stars you see in the night sky are so far away from Earth that the light from them has taken millions of years to reach you. So what you are really seeing is what those stars looked like millions of years ago. You are actually seeing into the past. To help us handle these huge distances, we use a special unit of measurement called a light-year to describe them. As its name suggests, a light-year is equal to the distance that light travels in one year. Light travels at 300,000 km per second in the vacuum of space. Objects that are moving away from Earth are red-shifted. Objects that are traveling towards Earth are blue-shifted.</p>

                    <h3>Question 4</h3>
                    <p>A pharmaceutical company was testing out a new drug that was intended to lower blood pressure in diabetic patients. Two groups of volunteers were assembled. Group 1 consisted of 200 men, whereas Group 2 consisted of 200 women. All of the trial’s participants were diabetics between the ages of 20 and 50 with similar lifestyles, diet, and general health. Group 2 was given the trial drug, while Group 1 was given a sugar pill as a placebo (fake pill).</p>

                    <h3>Question 5</h3>
                    <p>A majority of teenagers develop acne, but scientists still struggle to explain its cause. It has long been thought that bacteria play a role, although until recently it was assumed that role was purely detrimental—contributing to acne. However, a team of researchers began to wonder whether different strains of bacteria might impact acne in different ways. The research team studied 49 individuals with acne and 52 individuals without acne, and the researchers collected samples of bacteria from the nasal pores of all those individuals. The researchers found that some combinations of bacterial strains were highly likely to be found in clear skinned individuals, while other combinations were highly likely to be found in individuals with acne. After carefully analyzing their data, the scientists concluded that, while some bacterial combinations likely contribute to acne, other bacterial combinations may actually help to ward it off. The researchers suggested that, if further studies confirm these findings, we may want to treat acne by encouraging the growth of helpful bacteria.</p>

                    <p>1. The scientist repeated the experiment with a different set of 100 measles patients and found that 5 people had received one dose of measles vaccine, 3 people had received two doses, and 92 people had not had the vaccine. How can he best reconcile the data from these two studies to state a conclusion</p>
                    <label><input type="radio" name="ans1" value="A">A. The measles vaccine is 90% effective at preventing measles</label>
                    <label><input type="radio" name="ans1" value="B">B. The measles vaccine is highly effective at preventing measles and is most effective with two doses</label>

                    <p>2. Which of the following best shows why the researchers'conclusion is flawed?</p>
                    <label><input type="radio" name="ans2" value="A">A. They failed to compare the city’s air quality to that of any other towns, so they don’t know if greenhouse gases decreased more or less than they should have</label>
                    <label><input type="radio" name="ans2" value="B">B. They should have tested the city’s drinking water, too, since that has a greater effect on citizens’ health than air quality does</label>
                    <label><input type="radio" name="ans2" value="C">C. Their conclusion doesn’t explain the 15% difference between the decrease in greenhouse gases and the decrease in respiratory problems</label>
                    <label><input type="radio" name="ans2" value="D">D. They instituted two programs instead of one, so they can’t be sure which is responsible for the resulting health improvements</label>
