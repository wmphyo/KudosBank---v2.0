                    <h3>Question 1</h3>
                    <p>The Role of Government in the Economy</p>
                    <p>Governments play a crucial role in the economy by providing public goods, regulating markets, and redistributing income. Public goods, such as roads and national defense, are funded through taxation and benefit all citizens. Market regulation ensures fair competition and protects consumers from monopolies and unfair practices. Income redistribution, achieved through policies like progressive taxation and social welfare programs, aims to reduce economic inequality and support those in need.</p>

                    <h3>Question 2</h3>
                    <p>Economic Systems</p>
                    <p>Different countries adopt various economic systems to manage their resources and distribute goods and services. Capitalism emphasizes private ownership and free markets, while socialism advocates for collective ownership and planned economies. Mixed economies combine elements of both systems, balancing market freedom with government intervention to address social and economic issues.</p>

                    <h3>Question 3</h3>
                    <p>Globalization and Trade</p>
                    <p>Globalization refers to the increasing interconnectedness of economies around the world. It has led to the expansion of international trade, investment, and cultural exchange. While globalization has spurred economic growth and innovation, it has also created challenges such as job displacement, environmental degradation, and widening income inequality. Governments and international organizations work to manage these impacts through trade agreements, environmental regulations, and social policies.</p>

                    <h3>Question 4</h3>
                    <p>Fiscal and Monetary Policy</p>
                    <p>Fiscal policy involves government decisions on taxation and spending to influence the economy. By adjusting tax rates and public expenditure, governments can stimulate economic growth or curb inflation. Monetary policy, managed by central banks, controls the money supply and interest rates to maintain price stability and support economic objectives. These policies are essential tools for managing economic cycles and ensuring long-term stability.</p>

                    <h3>Question 5</h3>
                    <p>The Industrial Revolution</p>
                    <p>The Industrial Revolution was a period of significant technological advancement and industrial growth that began in the 18th century. It marked a shift from agrarian economies to industrialized ones, characterized by the use of machinery, mass production, and urbanization. This transformation led to increased productivity and economic growth, but it also brought social challenges such as poor working conditions, child labor, and environmental pollution. The Industrial Revolution laid the foundation for modern economies and continues to influence our world today.</p>
