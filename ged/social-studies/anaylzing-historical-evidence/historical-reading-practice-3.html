                    <h3>Question 1</h3>
                    <p>The Role of Women in World War II</p>
                    <p>During World War II, as men left to fight, women were called upon to fill roles in industries, the military, and public services. This marked a significant change from traditional gender roles, as women entered factories, shipyards, and even joined military forces in non-combat roles. By the end of the war, women had proven their capability in various sectors, leading to long-term changes in societal views on gender and work.</p>

                    <h3>Question 2</h3>
                    <p>Economic Impact of Women in the Workforce</p>
                    <p>With a shortage of male workers, women took over jobs that had been traditionally male-dominated. The rise of "Rosie the Riveter" became an iconic representation of women working in manufacturing and production roles. This participation in the labor force was crucial for the war effort and laid the groundwork for the women's rights movements that followed.</p>

                    <h3>Question 3</h3>
                    <p>Women's Contribution to the Military</p>
                    <p>Women not only supported the war effort through labor but also enlisted in military roles such as nurses, pilots, and communications officers. In the U.S., organizations like the Women’s Army Corps (WAC) and Women Airforce Service Pilots (WASP) allowed women to serve in positions that were previously inaccessible to them, breaking new ground for gender equality in the military.</p>

                    <h3>Question 4</h3>
                    <p>Long-Term Social Changes</p>
                    <p>The experiences of women during World War II had long-lasting effects on gender roles and expectations. After the war, many women chose to remain in the workforce, challenging traditional views on women’s roles in society. This shift was a precursor to the feminist movements of the 1960s and 1970s, which sought greater equality for women in all sectors of society.</p>

                    <h3>Question 5</h3>
                    <p>Women's Post-War Achievements</p>
                    <p>Following World War II, many women continued to pursue education, careers, and political activism. Figures such as Eleanor Roosevelt and Margaret Chase Smith were instrumental in advocating for women's rights, signaling a new era of gender equality. Women began to occupy roles in politics, education, and business that had once been closed to them, continuing the progress made during the war.</p>
