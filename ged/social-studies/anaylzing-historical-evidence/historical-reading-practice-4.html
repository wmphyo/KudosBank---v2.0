                    <h3>Question 1</h3>
                    <p>The Civil Rights Movement</p>
                    <p>The Civil Rights Movement of the 1950s and 1960s was a pivotal time in American history. This movement aimed to end racial segregation and discrimination against African Americans, especially in the southern United States. Key figures such as Martin Luther King Jr., Rosa Parks, and Malcolm X led nonviolent protests, boycotts, and legal challenges that eventually led to significant legal and social changes.</p>

                    <h3>Question 2</h3>
                    <p>Economic Inequality and Civil Rights</p>
                    <p>Despite legal victories, economic inequality remained a significant issue for African Americans. The movement also sought to address disparities in employment, housing, and education. Programs like the War on Poverty and Affirmative Action were implemented to improve economic opportunities, although the effectiveness and fairness of these programs were often debated.</p>

                    <h3>Question 3</h3>
                    <p>The Role of the Federal Government</p>
                    <p>The federal government played a crucial role in the success of the Civil Rights Movement. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 were landmark pieces of legislation that helped dismantle institutionalized racism. These laws prohibited discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin and ensured the protection of voting rights for all citizens.</p>

                    <h3>Question 4</h3>
                    <p>Legacy of the Civil Rights Movement</p>
                    <p>The Civil Rights Movement had a profound impact on American society, leading to greater social and political equality for African Americans. However, the fight for civil rights continues today, as issues such as police brutality, voter suppression, and systemic racism remain persistent challenges.</p>

                    <h3>Question 5</h3>
                    <p>Modern Civil Rights Challenges</p>
                    <p>While progress has been made since the 1960s, the fight for civil rights is far from over. Modern movements like Black Lives Matter continue to advocate for racial equality, drawing attention to ongoing issues such as mass incarceration, economic disparity, and discrimination in law enforcement. These movements highlight the need for continued activism and policy reform to achieve true equality.</p>
