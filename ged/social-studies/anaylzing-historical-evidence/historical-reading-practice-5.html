                    <h3>Question 1</h3>
                    <p>The Industrial Revolution</p>
                    <p>The Industrial Revolution was a period of significant economic and technological change that began in Britain in the late 18th century and spread to other parts of the world. It marked the transition from agrarian economies to industrialized and urban societies. Innovations such as the steam engine, textile machinery, and the factory system revolutionized production, leading to unprecedented economic growth and social changes.</p>

                    <h3>Question 2</h3>
                    <p>Impact on Labor</p>
                    <p>The Industrial Revolution had a profound impact on labor. The rise of factories brought about the mass employment of workers, including women and children, under often harsh and dangerous conditions. Labor movements began to emerge in response to the poor working conditions, leading to the formation of unions and the fight for workers' rights, including better wages, reasonable working hours, and safer workplaces.</p>

                    <h3>Question 3</h3>
                    <p>Urbanization and Social Change</p>
                    <p>The rapid industrialization led to the growth of cities as people moved from rural areas to urban centers in search of work. This urbanization resulted in overcrowded living conditions, inadequate public health services, and a rise in social issues such as poverty and crime. However, it also spurred advancements in infrastructure, education, and public health reforms, contributing to the modernization of society.</p>

                    <h3>Question 4</h3>
                    <p>Global Effects of Industrialization</p>
                    <p>The Industrial Revolution had global effects, including the expansion of European empires and the intensification of global trade. Colonies were often exploited for their resources, fueling industrial growth in Europe while contributing to economic and social disparities in the colonized regions. The global spread of industrialization also laid the groundwork for the modern global economy, with both positive and negative consequences.</p>

                    <h3>Question 5</h3>
                    <p>The Legacy of the Industrial Revolution</p>
                    <p>The legacy of the Industrial Revolution is complex. While it led to technological advancements and improved standards of living for many, it also created environmental challenges and deepened economic inequalities. The revolution set the stage for the modern world, influencing everything from the way we work to how societies are structured, and its impacts are still felt today.</p>
