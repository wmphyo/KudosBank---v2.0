A kind and merciful one, I trust, and none the worse for being a slaveholder.” This indicates that Calhoun felt completely justified in being a slaveholder, provided he treated his slaves with mercy. Calhoun seems to be concerned with the South’s equality with the North and not at all concerned with the equality of slaves. Frederick Douglass, a former slave, spoke of how slavery in any form, strips all dignity and humanity from the slaves. As stated by Douglass, “The first work of slavery is to mar and deface those characteristics of its victims which distinguish men from things, and persons from property.” He goes on to say that slaves are treated as mere machines. He believes that slaveholders must strip slaves of their humanity in order to control them."
